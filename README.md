# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Ambient-Sensors
ML project

Dataset used for the project is from UCI Machine Learning Repository :
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+ from+Continuous+Ambient+Sensor+Data#

# ML classification techniques
1. K-nearest neighbours
2. Naive Bayes (Gaussian Dristribution)
3. Support Vector machine
4. Random Forest
5. Decision Trees

# Evaluation of each ML technique is as below:

Random Forest > KNN > Decision Trees > Naive Bayes.
SVM took a lot of time to generate results
